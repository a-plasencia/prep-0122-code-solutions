        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>

        <p>So fun fact I've never watched an Indiana Jones movie before,
          I actually have no idea what happens in any of them besides
          this one. Since I'm pretty sure that this one has the face melting scene
          and that the beginning scene with the boulder is referenced very often.

      <div class="column">
        <img src="images/temple.jpg"
        alt="Picture of the Temple of Doom movie poster">
        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>I know the least about the Temple of DOom.  But from briefly looking
          up why it's so mixed.  Child slavery and human sacrifice as subjects
          they touched on certainly wasn't what I expected.  I also learned that
          on release it was banned in India.

      <div class="column">
        <img src="images/crusade.jpg"
        alt="Picture of The Last Crusade movie poster">
        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>The only thing I know about this one they are trying to find the
          holy grail.  There is also a scene where the villain drinks the wrong
          cup and turns into a skeleton.  I hear the puzzles were cool?
